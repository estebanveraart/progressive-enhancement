        <p><q>In nature, <span class="good">Good</span> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <span class="good">good</span> nor <span class="bad">bad</span>, but a potential in permanent development.</q></p>

    <p>Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter,</br>nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue.</p> 

    <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if</br>
    our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception</br> is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way,</br> our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p> 

    <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as spanine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the</br> spanine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the person is the same, you just changed your mind.</br> Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.</p>

    <h2>The story</h2>

    <img alt="The old Chinese Farmer" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IQqkmPXYZuJViY5p-ymk0A.jpeg">


    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</br> They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>?</br> I don't know.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</br>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.” </p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</br> The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,” and the farmer responded, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</br> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”</p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether</br> anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;</br>or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion </h4>
    <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good"></span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
