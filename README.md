# Progressive enhancement


This Repository is the result of my first exercise as part of my formation. It is a web designer formation with "Becode".

This exercise allows us to discover the basics of HTML and Css. Based on a Markdown document, "The Chinese Farmer", we had to reproduce it using html and then stylized it using CSS.

This exercise is one of the very first that we have done. His goal, to make us discover and especially to teach us to have the reflex to go to seek information. Any question have an answer on internet.

We still had instructions and a lot of stages. but everything could be found on the internet if there was any question.
